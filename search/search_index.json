Overview DevOps Test UI Test UI is an object-oriented automated testing tool that tests a wide range of desktop, Web, and mobile applications. Test UI provides automated testing capabilities for functional, regression, GUI, and data-driven testing. Overview DevOps Test Integrations and APIs Test Integrations and APIs is an integration testing and virtualization tool that includes capabilities to automate and run tests earlier and more often to find problems sooner in the development cycle. Overview DevOps Test Performance Test Performance is a scripting-free environment for automating load and scalability testing of web, ERP, and server-based software applications. Test Performance provides rich and customizable reporting to help you identify the presence and cause of system bottlenecks. It captures the network traffic that is rendered when the application under test interacts with a server. This network traffic is then emulated on multiple virtual users while you play back the test. Overview DevOps Test Embedded Test Embedded is a complete test and runtime analysis tool set for systems development created in any cross-development environment. Test Embedded provides tools for automated component testing, code coverage, memory leak detection, performance profiling, and UML sequence diagram tracing.

Helping test teams increase test coverage Freeing testers from having to execute test scripts manually by following a series of documented test steps allows them to focus on improving the overall test effort - identify missing test cases, focus on exploratory testing, improving test practices eliminating waste, etc... Improving testing accuracy Let's face it, people make mistakes. Automated testing is software designed to repeatedly and consistently execute a series of steps against the application under test over and over to verify functions and features. Accelerating feeback on software quality As automated testing is faster, can be run as part of a deployment process, and consistently executes to verify software quality, the results of those test executions can be immediately shared directly back to the development team providing continuous feedback on software quality. Improving team morale By allowing Testers to focus on improving the testing practice and providing Developers accelerated feedback on the sofware they are developing can only lead to improved morale."},{"location":"#about-the-learning-environment","title":"About the learning environment","text":""},{"location":"#etm-setup","title":"ETM Setup","text":"<p>In order to share details and experience hands on learning with how to configure and exercise the connection between ETM and DevOps Test UI, the JKE Banking (Quality Management) project was added to ELM as part of installing the Money that Matters sample application.
