Overview DevOps Test UI Test UI is an object-oriented automated testing tool that tests a wide range of desktop, Web, and mobile applications. Test UI provides automated testing capabilities for functional, regression, GUI, and data-driven testing. Overview DevOps Test Integrations and APIs Test Integrations and APIs is an integration testing and virtualization tool that includes capabilities to automate and run tests earlier and more often to find problems sooner in the development cycle. Overview DevOps Test Performance Test Performance is a scripting-free environment for automating load and scalability testing of web, ERP, and server-based software applications. Test Performance provides rich and customizable reporting to help you identify the presence and cause of system bottlenecks. It captures the network traffic that is rendered when the application under test interacts with a server. This network traffic is then emulated on multiple virtual users while you play back the test.

Where automated testing is software designed to repeat a series of steps against the application under test over and over. | | Accelerating feeback on software quality | As automated testing is faster, can be run as part of a deployment process, and consistently executes to verify software quality, the results of those test executions can be shared directly back to the development team providing continuous feedback on software quality. | | Improving team morale | By allowing Testers to focus on improving the testing practice and providing Developers accelerated feedback on the sofware they are developing can only lead to improved morale. |</p>"},{"location":"#about-this-workbook","title":"About this workbook","text":"<p>This workbook is limited to sharing details for how engineering teams can connect automated test scripts (authored in one of the many DevOps Test solutions) with test cases (managed in Engineering Test Management) for the purpose of automating test execution and delivering feedback on software quality to developers faster. If you are interested in learning more about test management and test automation capabilities offered by IBM Software:  To learn more about test management in ETM visitIBM's ETM documentation webpage..  To learn more about test automation with DevOps Test visit IBM's DevOps Test documentation webpage. </p> <p>In this workbook, you will learn how to: 1. Configure Test Adapters creating a communication channel between ETM AND DevOps Test 2. Add and automated test script to ETM and link to the DevOps Test script 3. Execute the test from ETM and observe the DevOps Test autoamted test playback 4. Review the test execution results returned to ETM from DevOps Test</p>"}]}
