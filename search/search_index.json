Overview DevOps Test UI Test UI is an object-oriented automated testing tool that tests a wide range of desktop, Web, and mobile applications. Test UI provides automated testing capabilities for functional, regression, GUI, and data-driven testing. Overview DevOps Test Integrations and APIs Test Integrations and APIs is an integration testing and virtualization tool that includes capabilities to automate and run tests earlier and more often to find problems sooner in the development cycle. Overview DevOps Test Performance Test Performance is a scripting-free environment for automating load and scalability testing of web, ERP, and server-based software applications. Test Performance provides rich and customizable reporting to help you identify the presence and cause of system bottlenecks. It captures the network traffic that is rendered when the application under test interacts with a server. This network traffic is then emulated on multiple virtual users while you play back the test.

Helping test teams increase test coverage Freeing testers from having to execute test scripts manually by following a series of documented test steps allows them to focus on improving the overall test effort - identify missing test cases, focus on exploratory testing, improving test practices eliminating waste, etc... Improving testing accuracy Let's face it, people make mistakes. Automated testing is software designed to repeatedly and consistently execute a series of steps against the application under test over and over to verify functions and features. Accelerating feeback on software quality As automated testing is faster, can be run as part of a deployment process, and consistently executes to verify software quality, the results of those test executions can be immediately shared directly back to the development team providing continuous feedback on software quality. Improving team morale By allowing Testers to focus on improving the testing practice and providing Developers accelerated feedback on the sofware they are developing can only lead to improved morale."},{"location":"#about-the-learning-environment","title":"About the learning environment","text":"<p>ETM Setup: In order to share details and experience hands on learning with how to configure and exercise the connection between ETM and DevOps Test UI, the JKE Banking (Quality Management) project was added to ELM as part of installing the Money that Matters sample application. In addition, to enable the Test Hub adapter in ETM, the DevOps Test Hub adapter files have been downloaded and installed ETM. For details on how to install the DevOps Test Hub adapter files in ETM, refer to the instructions available at the following URL : https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/devops-test-hub/11.0.6?topic=management-adding-adapter-files-engineering-test</p> <p>DevOps Test UI Setup: As the scope of this exercise is to share details on how to integrate DevOps Test with ETM and not provide details on how to record and modify an automated test script, a Test UI project has been already created and an automated test script recorded. Details of the test script are a follows: 1. Launches the application under test in a browser. 2. Modifies several field on the UI to submit a donation to the charity of choosing. 3. Posts the donation. 4. Verifies the donation has been successfully submited. 5. Browser closes/ test ends.</p> <p>Application Under Test (AUT) Setup: The \"JKE Banking - Donations\" demo application being subjected to test automation is a simple html file containing javascript. It is deployed as a docker container running on an nginx server to host the index.html file on port 81 (http://127.0.0.1:81) and starts up during boot of the RHEL OS.</p> <p>Chrome/Firefox Browser Setup: Both browser applications have bookmarks available to conveniently access the Workbook, the ELM instance, and the JKE Banking - Donations demo application.</p>"},{"location":"#about-this-workbook","title":"About this workbook","text":"<p>The scope of this workbook is to share details on how engineering teams can connect automated test scripts (authored in one of the many DevOps Test solutions) with test cases (managed in Engineering Test Management) for the purpose of automating test execution and delivering feedback on software quality to developers faster.
