Overview <p>| DevOps Test UI | Test UI is an object-oriented automated testing tool that tests a wide range of desktop, Web, and mobile applications. Test UI provides automated testing capabilities for functional, regression, GUI, and data-driven testing. | Overview |</p> <p>| DevOps Test Integrations and APIs | Test Integrations and APIs is an integration testing and virtualization tool that includes capabilities to automate and run tests earlier and more often to find problems sooner in the development cycle.| Overview |</p> <p>| DevOps Test Performance | Test Performance is a scripting-free environment for automating load and scalability testing of web, ERP, and server-based software applications. Test Performance provides rich and customizable reporting to help you identify the presence and cause of system bottlenecks. It captures the network traffic that is rendered when the application under test interacts with a server. This network traffic is then emulated on multiple virtual users while you play back the test. | Overview |</p>"},{"location":"#why-integrate-ibm-devops-test-automation-with-ibm-enterprise-test-management","title":"Why integrate IBM DevOps Test Automation with IBM Enterprise Test Management","text":""},{"location":"#in-this-workbook-you-will-learn-how-to","title":"In this workbook, you will learn how to:","text":""},{"location":"#1-configure-test-adapters-creating-a-communication-channel-between-etm-and-devops-test","title":"1.
